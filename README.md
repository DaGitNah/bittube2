# What is BitTube 

BiTtube is a decentralised video sharing platfrom. Bascially, people upload content and they get paid for through a cryptocurrency similar to steemit


# Why Does BitTube Exist? 

Our mission is to provide a community-based advertisement-free platform for sharing a wide variety of video content using state-of-the-art distribution techniques, personal appreciation, and a beneficial crypto-currency earning model toward its publishers and viewers.

Inspired by our dissatisfaction with advertising-supported online video sites, we seek to use block-chain technology to achieve our vision. BitTube connects content creators, and viewers in an open advertisement-free marketplace for video, podcast or audio -- where viewers determine the value of the content, and creators realize income from their work through cryptocurrencies. 

# So what Lisense does BitTube all under? 

We are under the MIT Lisense. So feel free to take the software, modify it, and do what you want.
